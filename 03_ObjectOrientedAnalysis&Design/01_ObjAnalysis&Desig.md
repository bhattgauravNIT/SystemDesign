A software development lifecycle is composed of multiple stages like

1. Feature & system analysis
2. Object Oriented analysis and design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Verification like internal demo's etc
6. Deployment

So Object oriented analysis and design is a key step in creation of a feature or building up of
a system.

Object oriented analysis involves:

a) Understanding system requirements
b) Introduction of new object & classes if needed
c) Formulating the relationship between them


In object oriented design then based upon our analysis we implement the design.
