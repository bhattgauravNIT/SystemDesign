UML refers to Unified modelling language and its a standard way for visual representation 
of system or a feature in a system which we are building that how they it will behave interact etc.
It acts as a plan or blueprint for developers, architects, and stakeholders. It helps everyone understand, 
design, and communicate how a software system works.

UML has 3 aspects:

1) Things
2) Relationship
3) Diagram


######Things:

Things in UML is composed of

1) Structural
2) Behavioral
3) Grouping

Structural in things inside UML is composed of following; 

a) Classes: 

Classes are simple classes which are used for encapsulation of states/instance variables and behavior/methods.
Classes are represented as ![alt text](/03_ObjectOrientedAnalysis&Design/Images/Classes.png)

b) Objects:

Objects of classes in UML are represented as ![alt text](Images/Object.png)

c) Interface:

Interfaces are represented as ![alt text](Images/Interface.png)

d) Use case:

As name suggest use case refers to the use case which the system provides to the user or which the system
is currently dealing with in context to current design ![alt text](Images/UseCase.png)

e) Actor:

Actor refers to the user or the person who will interact with the system. ![alt text](Images/Actor.png)

f) Component:

As name suggest component refers to the section or part of the system which we are dealing with and is
represented as ![alt text](Images/Component.png)

g) Node:

Node refers to the physical aspect of the system such as server as is represented as ![alt text](/Images/Node.png)


Behavioral in things inside UML refers to the system interactions is composed of following:

a) Activity diagram:

It refers to the interaction on the component and An Activity Diagram represents the workflow or process flow of a 
system . It is represented by ![alt text](Images/ActivityDiagram.png)

b)Interaction diagram:

It refers to the interactions between the two components or An Interaction Diagram represents 
the interactions between objects over time. It focuses on how objects communicate to accomplish a task.
