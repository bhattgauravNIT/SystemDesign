In software world, say we need to sort items and there exists a sort method which will help us
in sorting, so some repetitive problems has standard solutions which can be reused. Lets take another example
if we are planning to build a new city than there lies some problems like garbage, sewage facility etc, all
these problems are common with introducing mostly all the new cities and thus we every time need not re invent
the wheel rather than use existing solutions.

In the same way while creating a new system, we can reuse some of the already existing design templates and these design templates are called as design patterns.


There exists in general 4 types of design pattern:

1) Creational design pattern
2) Structural design pattern
3) Behavioral design pattern
4) Architectural design pattern



**Architectural design pattern**

Angular uses MVC architecture, sometimes in backend we use DAO layers to take data from the database, all
these like MVM, MVC, DAO even dependency injection all are considered as architectural design pattern.
